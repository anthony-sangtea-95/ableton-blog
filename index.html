                    Ableton was founded in 1999 and released the first version of Live in 2001. Our products are used by

                    incredibly rewarding.</h3>
                <p>
                    We feel the same way about making Ableton products. The driving force behind Ableton is our passion
                    for what we make, and the people we make it for.

                <p>
                    Most of us are active musicians, producers, and DJs, and many of us use Live and Push everyday. We
                    come from a wide range of cultural and professional backgrounds. Some of us have PhDs, some are
                    self-taught, and most of us are somewhere in between. What connects us is the shared belief that
                    each of us has the skills and knowledge to contribute to something big: helping to shape the future
                    of music culture.

                    are richly diverse, and thus able to explore problems from a wider set of perspectives. We don't
                    always agree with each other, but opinion and debate are valued and openly encouraged.
